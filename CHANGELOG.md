# Changelog

Notable changes to TensorMixedStates are recorded here, in the format of
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The package should follows
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

This file starts with the release in preparation. For what came before, see the
[tags](https://github.com/jerhoud/TensorMixedStates.jl/tags); version 1.2.8 is the one
archived as the [codebase release](https://doi.org/10.21468/SciPostPhysCodeb.72-r1.28) of
the reference article.

## [Unreleased]

The next release carries a user visible change of behaviour, the removal of MKL, so it is
expected to be 1.3.0 rather than a patch.

### Added

- `Qudit` site type, and richer operator sets on several existing site types.
- Checkpointing: a simulation can be stopped and restarted from where it stopped, driven by
  `checkpoint_interval` and `max_time`.
- `SaveState` and `LoadState` phases, to write a state to disk and read it back.
- `sample`, to draw measurement outcomes from a state.
- `SetState`, and an integer parameter to `Proj` and `state`, which `controlled` now uses.
- `square_lattice`, alongside the existing graph helpers.
- Multi site function operators.
- `matrix` and `tensor` for `Dissipator`.
- `Evolve` accepts vectors in `Limits`.
- `CITATION.cff`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` and this changelog.

### Changed

- **MKL is no longer a dependency.** It was used for the single purpose of switching the
  BLAS backend of the whole Julia session, which is a decision that belongs to the
  application rather than to a library, and `MKL_jll` ships `x86_64` Linux and Windows
  binaries only, so the package could not be installed on macOS or on any ARM machine.
  OpenBLAS, which Julia ships, is now used as it comes. Users on `x86_64` who want the
  performance of MKL load it themselves before TMS; the Installation section of the manual
  says how.
- `@def_operators` binds an operator name only the first time it sees it. A name already in
  scope is registered for the new site and checked against what it already stands for,
  rather than bound again. This makes the sharing of a name between site types explicit and
  enforced instead of accidental, refuses a declaration whose `OpType` disagrees, and
  removes an error that made the package unusable from Julia 1.10 and 1.11 as soon as a
  user declared an operator whose name a loaded site module exported.
- **A `SimData` can no longer be used as a phase of another simulation.** It has the shape
  of a phase only because `runTMS` runs the top level one through the same machinery. Use
  nested vectors to build a list of phases in pieces, which is the documented way and is
  flattened on construction.
- `julia = "1.10.5"` in `[compat]`, which reads as `[1.10.5, 2.0.0)`. The package no longer
  becomes uninstallable on the day a new Julia minor version is released.
- `simplify` always expands multi site operators, which makes its result predictable.
- Global identifiers are `const`.
- Tensors are kept real instead of complex whenever possible.
- Error messages name what was not found and what was expected.
- Measurement names, the display of phases and the were made more regular.
- The reference article is published: it is
  [SciPost Phys. Codebases 72 (2026)](https://doi.org/10.21468/SciPostPhysCodeb.72), and the
  README and manual cite it instead of the preprint.

### Fixed

- **A `SimData` nested inside the phases of another silently skipped its inner phases.**
  The loop it opened shared the phase counter of the loop around it, so every inner phase
  whose index was below the outer one was passed over, on the very first run and with no
  checkpoint involved. It is now refused outright.
- `renyi2` and `mutual_info_renyi2`.
- `dag` and `expect2` on fermionic operators, and `expect` in the presence of `Multi_F`.
- Time dependent evolution, which was broken.
- Files and data sets are properly terminated.
- Applying gates is safer, and `expect` no longer trips on an unsimplified expression.

### Documentation

- The examples of the manual and of the reference pages are executed at every documentation
  build, so the build fails when an example stops working. Converting them found and fixed
  five errors that indented code blocks had been hiding.
- Versioned documentation is published: `stable` now points at the latest release instead of
  the development branch.
- New sections on the choice of the BLAS backend and on reusing an operator name across
  site types, and a word asking authors who use TMS to acknowledge it and to get in touch.

### Development

- Continuous integration runs on the development branch, not only on `main`, and the matrix
  covers the minimum Julia version that `[compat]` promises, the current stable one and the
  upcoming release, on Linux and on Apple Silicon.
- The test suite went from about 190 assertions to more than 600, organised in groups that
  can be run selectively.
